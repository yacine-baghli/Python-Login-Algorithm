### Python Login Algorithm

#### Overview:
This Python script implements a simple login system. It prompts the user for their username and, if the username exists, asks for their password. If the password is correct, it grants access. The program allows the user three attempts to enter their password. It is also case-insensitive for the username.

#### Usage:
1. Run the Python script `login.py`.
2. Enter your username when prompted.
3. If the username exists, enter your password.
4. If the password is correct, "Access Granted" will be displayed.
5. You have three attempts to enter your password correctly.

#### Note:
This program is designed for educational purposes and may not provide robust security. It serves as a basic demonstration of a login system implemented in Python.
